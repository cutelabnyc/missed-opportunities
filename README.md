# Missed Opportunities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cutelabnyc/missed-opportunities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cutelabnyc/missed-opportunities)

_Keep on missing each other, Our world's out of order, All I see is Missed Opportunity_

## Installation

Make sure platform io command line tools are installed

```
brew install platformio
```

## Development

After creating a feature branch, you can build locally without the module plugged in to make sure the code can compile

```
pio run
```

Then plug the prototype board into your computer to unit test

```
pio test
```

Finally, upload the code with the optional `monitor` flag to view the output of any Serial monitors put in for debugging.

```
pio run --target upload --target monitor
```

After pull requesting, Travis CI will make sure that the code is able to compile and perform integration testing in order to make sure everything is squeaky clean before merging

## Notes

General To-Dos:

- Make sure CI cycle is working
- Structure a basic outline from diagram on new branch
- Write unit tests and integration tests
  1. Add a unit test for a full input range on the atmega's analogIn function (0-1023)
- Structure the main loop to integrate a debugging mode where the Serial monitor is turned on
